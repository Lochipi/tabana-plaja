# tabana plaja

Welcome to this project!

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

# Development

You can start working on the project by editing files inside `app/` directory.

# Code Quality

We care about keeping the code clean and consistent. Here's what We use:

- _Prettier_ for code formatting (e.g., spacing, quotes, etc.)
- _ESLint_ for finding common code issues
- _Husky_ for running checks automatically before commiting the code

## Pre-commit

Before each commit, Husky runs a check using Prettier and ESLint. If your commit is blocked, that means something needs fixing - probably formatting or a lint error.
You can fix most issues by running:

```bash
bun run lint     # Run ESLint
bun run format   # Run Prettier
```

# Contributing

Thank you for showing the interest in contributing; welcome! Fix that issue (type, or even add a feature!)

### Before you commit:

Please run the following commands:

```bash
bun run lint
bun run format
```

This checks for issues and formats your code to match our style.

‚ö†Ô∏è Running `prettier --write .` will format everything, which might take some time when(if) our project grows.
You might want to format specific files instead:

```bash
# Format a folder
prettier --write app/

# Format one file
prettier --write app/components/Button.js

# Format all tests in a folder using a glob
prettier --write "app/**/*.test.js"
```

See [fast-glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#pattern-syntax) for more about glob syntax.
